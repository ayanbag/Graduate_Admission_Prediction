[![built with Streamlit](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with%20-Streamlit-brightgreen)](https://www.streamlit.io/)


Graduate Admission Prediction (GAP) is an analysis project based on my paper "A Comparative Study of Regression Algorithms for Predicting Graduate Admission to a University" (read my [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343280957_A_Comparative_Study_of_Regression_Algorithms_for_Predicting_Graduate_Admission_to_a_University)). It is built with Python and Streamlit.



The dataset , we used in this project is take from "Mohan S Acharya, Asfia Armaan, Aneeta S Antony : A Comparison of Regression Models for Prediction of Graduate Admissions, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019" Paper. This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset.
